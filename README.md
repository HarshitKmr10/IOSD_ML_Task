## Task - 1 <br>
For task 1 I have made two solutions one using SMOTE and one without. The model which is not using SMOTE although performs better(only in terms of accuracy) here but since the imbalance in the data is very large use of SMOTE/nearmiss is suggested. <hr>
## Task - 2<br>
I have made a simple of baseline using four layers.
